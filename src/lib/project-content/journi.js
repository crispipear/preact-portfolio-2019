            For our senior capstone project in 2019, our whole team performed UX Research and designed a solution around a problem. My other role within this project was to develop a mobile prototype of this app and the product showcase video production.

            <h1>background research</h1>
            <p>
            The initial social issue that we looked at was safety concerns targeting women. Throughout our research, we also found that solo traveling has been a rising trend especially in the young female group.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, we want our tool to be opened to all user groupos. We decided to narrow down our scope to solo traveling and safety and gathered more data from online survey results and database.

            To further analyze the problem and understand the common travel safety concerns, we performed <b>12</b> qualitative interviews and questionnaire survey with <b>100</b> responses.

                1. It is difficult to do research on information related to safe traveling areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. There are no concise information and guides for safe traveling.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Solo travelers are concerned about accessible solution under emergency situations.

            <p>
            We did analysis on similar/potential competitors such as Airbnb, Google Trips, Trip Advisor and Booking.com. The features are more towards the area of “reporting” which is reactive instead of preventative.
            </p>
            <p>
            We came to a conclusion that our opportunity window lies within a product that provides effective and proactive features.
